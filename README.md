## Hi
Here are stuff that you need to do. Feel free to add, modify, or delete stuff in the html file as long as the layout looks exactly the same.
You can also rename the html files if you'd like, as long as they make sense.

And uh please try to center divs vertically in some webpages. Would be greatly appreciated. :')

Also pls read everything before doing these because some tasks are related to different parts of the website.
It's like task A requires both webpage B and C to fully function.

Btw I think you should make a folder for scripts to keep things organized.

# index.html
### div.part-1
- The form can only be used by *one* person, *once* a week.
- The form can be used again **only if a new promo code arrives.**
- If the first person submits with the correct promocode, the info the user provided has to go in div.part-3 where I typed out "payment details blah blah blah insert whatever".
- If the user decided to add a message (even though it's optional), also put them in the place where I typed "optional message hi".
- If anyone else submits even though someone submitted it earlier, notify them "Sorry, someone has used this promo code earlier than you. Maybe you'll win someday, but not today."
- If the person inputs the incorrect promocode, notify them "Sorry, I do not know such promo code."

### div.part-2
- **IF AND ONLY IF** the user has made an account AND subscribed, remove the "sign up and subscribe to see" button and replace that with the actual promo code.
- Rewards should only update when a new promo code appears.
- Please replace 0.02 with 0.02 * amount of subscribers I have (not Youtube subscribers).
- What I mean by subscribers is the amount of people who bought a subscription from this site.
- I've separated the $ and 0.02 to make it convenient but feel free to modify, add, or delete some, as stated above.

### div.part-3
- For the sake of privacy, please blur "payment details".
- Remove the blur **only** when I press Shift+R & Ctrl+Shift+M. Only you, me, and my mom should know this.
- If the user decides to write a message, put it in "optional message". Don't censor anything in it. If the user didn't write a message, just put blank in there.
- Change "better luck next time" to "No one has submitted yet. Quick, be the first one to use it!" only when a new promo code has been generated and no one has submitted the form yet.

### div.part-4
Those are just my social media. Ignore them.

# control (index.html)
This is a really, really, REALLY secretive one. Remember about what I said in **dive.part-3**? Yeah like that but this one's more private and **only you and me are allowed know this**.

- If I press Ctrl+shift+f, a search bar must appear with an enter button. it looks like something in **meke-meke-mooie.html**, I know the name's kinda stupid.
The search bar has to float on the bottom right corner.
The search bar must have a transparent background color.
It must not move anywhere when I scroll.
If I hit the enter button, the search bar should disappear.
I should be able to do this as many times as I want to.

- If someone else discovers this and they don't type anything that's the exact same to the things listed below, notify them "Nice to meet ya!".
After that, the search bar must also disappear.
Search bar must never appear again even if the user refreshes.
However, search bar could appear again if the user leaves the website and goes back into the website. 

1. If I input "**HI-TIS-ME-PLS-LET-ME-IN-2-1-2-7-3aaa**" then press enter, search bar must not disappear and the website must set to owner mode.
Which means I can see promo codes and 'Details' without having to sign up or log in.

2. If I input "**GENERAT3-PROMOCOD3-333-910045**" then press enter, the search bar must not disappear and a new promo code should be generated.
Once this happens, Everyone who subscribed to this website will receive a notification saying "A new promo code has appeared, get it while it's hot and fresh!"
"payment details" in div.part-3 must be reset as well as the optional message.

3. If I input "**GOODBYE-AND-GO-AWAY**" then press enter, the search bar disappears.

These steps have to be in order, otherwise make the search bar disappear.

# account.html 
- Add a button that shows a user's password in the input.
- If user has never made an account and pressed login, notify them "Sorry, can't find that account.".
- If user has never made an account and pressed signup, create an account for the user and redirect them to **subscribe.html**.
- If user has never made an account and typed a username that's already registered, please put "Username taken" under input. Otherwise don't change anything. 
- If user has made an account before and pressed login, send them back to **index.html**. If they got their username or password incorrect, notify them "Incorrect password or username, you should've written them out.".
- If user has made an account before and pressed signup, notify them "This account has already been registered."
- If user has made an account but decides to make another one, create the account and redirect the account to **subscribe.html**.

# subscribe.html
- Add payment options (I'm not old enough so I'm letting my mom help me).

# info.html
- Highlight "How are rewards calculated?" if user clicked the link from "How are rewards calculated?" in index.html.
- When the user clicks 'allow notifications', a question saying something like 'allow notifications on this site?' should appear. Not on the website but from the browser itself.

# End of file - All the things listed above are of extreme importance.
- If you don't know how to do a certain task, find another way. notify me how it works if it's different from what I requested.
- If I haven't specified something clearly or need more information on something, please tell me.
- Deadline would be at the end of June. I can extend it to the end of July but by then I'll have to assume that you've fixed all possible bugs and also optimized performance.

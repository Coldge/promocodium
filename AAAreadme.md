## Hi
Here are stuff that you need to do. Feel free to add, modify, or delete stuff in the html file as long as the layout looks exactly the same.

**All of the things listed above are required.**

Oh and uh ignore whatever's in the rejected folder, I'm not using those anymore.

Also pls read everything before doing these because some tasks are related to different parts of the website.
It's like task A requires both webpage B and C to fully function.

# index.html
**div.part-1**
The form can only be used by *one* person, *once* a week.

The form can be used again **only if a new promo code arrives.**

If the first person submits with the correct promocode, the info the user provided has to go in div.part-3 where I typed out "payment details blah blah blah insert whatever".

If the user decided to add a message (even though it's optional), also put them in the place where I typed "optional message hi".

If anyone else submits even though someone submitted it earlier, notify them "Sorry, someone has used this promo code earlier than you. Maybe you'll win someday, but not today."

If the person inputs the incorrect promocode, notify them "Sorry, I do not know such promo code."

**div.part-2**
Please replace 0.02 with 0.02 * amount of subscribers I have (not Youtube subscribers.

What I mean by subscribers is the amount of people who bought a subscription from this site.

I've separated the $ and 0.02 to make it convenient but feel free to modify, add, or delete some, as stated above.

**div.part-3**
For the sake of privacy, please blur "payment details".

Remove the blur **only** when I press Shift+R & Ctrl+Shift+M. Only you, me, and my mom should know this.

If the user decides to write a message, put it in "optional message". Don't censor anything in it. If the user didn't write a message, just put blank in there.

Change "better luck next time" to "No one has submitted yet. Quick, be the first to be here!" only when a new promo code has been generated and no one has submitted the form yet.

**div.part-4**
Those are just my social media. Ignore them.

    <h1 class="intro">What is this?</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Promocodium! This website gives out money to anyone with a small monthly price. You'd also need access to promo codes to be able to have the money.</p>
    <h1>What are promo codes?</h1>
    <p>In this website, they are codes that only a few people can see if they paid for a subscription. This website's promo code has 10 random characters that consist of numbers, letters, and unique characters like !@#$%^&*(). The promo codes also offer potential $$$.</p>
    <h1>How do I know if this website is not a scam?</h1>
    <p>I send the money <b>manually, by hand.</b> I also send proof every week on my <a href="http://instagram.com/choco_berryz">Instagram</a>.</p>
    <h1>Why do I need to subscribe to see promo codes?</h1>
    <p>It's how I'm able to keep this site alive and to give people a few bucks.</p>
    <h1>Why do I need to make an account to subscribe?</h1>
    <p>So you don't have to subscribe again in a different device. <br><br> For example, let's say you've recently subscribed on a phone. Not long after, you bought a new phone and got rid of the old one. Then you also remembered that you subscribed to Promocodium. Luckily, you only need to login to your account so it's very convenient.</p>
    <h1 id="rewards">How are rewards calculated?</h1>
    <p>$0.02 x current subscribers.</p>
    <h1>Why do I need to invite more people onto your website?</h1>
    <p>The more the merrier! The more people subscribing means the bigger the rewards will be.</p>
    <h1>When do you give out promo codes?</h1>
    <p>I give them out at 8pm GMT+7 on a Saturday night. Every Saturday. If you'd like to be the earliest bird, simply <button>allow notifications</button> on this site. it'll only notify you about new promo codes and remind you to renew your subscription within 3 days.</p>
    <h1>what happens if the first person doesn't put the correct info in 'Details' and managed to be in "This week's early bird"?</h1>
    <p>Simple, I don't give them the money. You'd have to wait next week for a new promo code.</p>
    <h1>What do I need to put in 'Details'?</h1>
    <p>For <b>PayPal</b>, simply type in your email address. <br> For <b>TransferWise</b>, you only need your email address as well. Unless you prefer bank, then you'd have to enter in your bank details. Anything in 'Details' are censored to everyone and only I can see it, so don't worry. <br><br> Here's an example: <br> PayPal <br> urname@gmail.com <br><br> <b>Note: I can only use PayPal for rewards at $10 or under. <br>Also note: rewards are USD only.</b></p>
